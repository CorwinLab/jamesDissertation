	abstract = {At the core of equilibrium statistical mechanics lies the notion of statistical ensembles: a collection of microstates, each occurring with a given a priori probability that depends only on a few macroscopic parameters such as temperature, pressure, volume, and energy. In this review article, we discuss recent advances in establishing statistical ensembles for athermal materials. The broad class of granular and particulate materials is immune from the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations because the constituents are macroscopic. In addition, interactions between grains are frictional and dissipative, which invalidates the fundamental postulates of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, granular materials exhibit distributions of microscopic quantities that are reproducible and often depend on only a few macroscopic parameters. We explore the history of statistical ensemble ideas in the context of granular materials, clarify the nature of such ensembles and their foundational principles, highlight advances in testing key ideas, and discuss applications of ensembles to analyze the collective behavior of granular materials.},

The FNE can be seen as a restricted Edwards ensemble,17 with an extensive measure of the stress playing a role analogous to energy in equilibrium statistical mechanics.35,36 The ensemble then allows one to explore the consequences of and limits to the Edwards approach. For example, we will see that one popular notion, namely that entropy maximization implies robustly exponential force statistics,37 does not survive confrontation with the FNE.},

	abstract = {There is now ample experimental and computational evidence that a welldeﬁned and reproducible state can be achieved in a granular system under a repeated disturbance, e.g., if subjected to disturbance of amplitude A and frequency ω, a volume V (A, ω) is found which will be returned to if the system is subjected to A , ω and then to A, ω. A microcanonical ensemble deﬁnes the entropy from volume V , where V equals the volume function W , just as E equals H in conventional statistical physics. A canonical version exists via a compactivity ∂V /∂S. Granular systems also have a distribution of intergranular forces generated by external forces or gravity. This paper shows that the idea that the conﬁgurations are determined by the Gibbsian formula exp(−W (∂S/∂V )) can be extended to the distribution of forces with a microcanonical condition P (external) = (force moments in grains)/V via exp(− (∂S/∂P )). The canonical ensemble immediately gives the exponential distribution of intergranular forces, found experimentally. The distribution must depend on the conﬁguration and any physical property will have a value averaged over conﬁgurations, i.e. will give rise to a spinglass problem.},

Here we study the statistics of ensembles of hyperstatic frictionless force networks, which are composed of more forces than can be determined uniquely from force balance. Hyperstatic force networks possess degrees of freedom that rearrange one balanced network into another. We calculate the equation of state and demonstrate that the number of rearrangements governs the macroscopic statistical properties of the ensemble, in particular the macroscopic ﬂuctuations of stress, which scale with distance to the isostatic point. We then show that a maximum entropy postulate allows one to quantitatively capture many features of the microscopic statistics. All predictions are tested against highly accurate Monte Carlo numerical simulations employing umbrella sampling.},

So far, however, there exists no theoretical framework which can explain the observations in a unified manner beyond the phenomenological jamming diagram [1]. This work focuses on the case of static granular matter, where we have constructed a statistical ensemble [2] which mirrors equilibrium statistical mechanics. This ensemble, which is based on the conservation properties of the stress tensor, is distinct from the original Edwards ensemble and applies to packings of deformable grains. We combine it with a field theoretical analysis of the packings, where the field is the Airy stress function derived from the force and torque balance conditions. In this framework, Point J characterized by a diverging stiffness of the pressure fluctuations. Separately, we present a phenomenological mean-field theory of the jamming transition, which incorporates the mean contact number as a variable. We link both approaches in the context of the marginal rigidity picture proposed by [3, 4].},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical advances offer an exact, first-principle theory of jamming criticality in infinite dimension as well as universal scaling relations between critical exponents in all dimensions. For packings of frictionless spheres near the jamming transition, these advances predict that nontrivial power-law exponents characterize the critical distribution of (i) small inter-particle gaps and (ii) weak contact forces, both of which are crucial for mechanical stability. The scaling of the inter-particle gaps is known to be constant in all spatial dimensions \$d\$ -- including the physically relevant \$d=2\$ and 3, but the value of the weak force exponent remains the object of debate and confusion. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by numerical simulations. We construct isostatic jammed packings with extremely high accuracy, and introduce a simple criterion to separate the contribution of particles that give rise to localized buckling excitations, i.e., bucklers, from the others. This analysis reveals the remarkable dimensional robustness of mean-field marginality and its associated criticality.},

          , 
            
              Jamming occurs when objects like grains are packed tightly together (
              e.g.
              grain silos). It is highly cooperative and can lead to phenomena like earthquakes, traffic jams,
              etc.
              In this paper we point out the paramount importance of the underlying contact network for jammed systems; the network must have one contact in excess of isostaticity and a finite bulk modulus. Isostatic means that the number of degrees of freedom is exactly balanced by the number of constraints. This defines a large class of networks that can be constructed without the necessity of packing particles together compressively (either in the lab or computationally). One such construction, which we explore here, involves setting up the Delaunay triangulation of a Poisson disk sampling and then removing edges to maximize the bulk modulus until the isostatic plus one edge is reached. This construction works in any dimensions and here we give results in 2D where we also show how such networks can be transformed into disk packs.},

In addition, we identify deviations from mean-field predictions, and present detailed analysis of the origin of non-mean-field behavior. A mean-field bulk-surface argument is reviewed. Corrections to this argument are identified, which lead to a change in the functional form of the critical PTS boundary size R0. An entropic description of the origin of the correlations is presented, and simple rigidity assumptions are shown to predict the functional form of R0 as a function of the pressure P.},

	abstract = {When a system jams it undergoes a transition from a ﬂowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the ﬂuid phase. In this way jamming is very diﬀerent from crystallization, the other common way in which a ﬂuid solidiﬁes. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many diﬀerent types of ﬂuids – from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter –develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model of frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive ﬁnite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly-idealized case, the transition has aspects of both ﬁrst- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We ﬁrst survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable.},

	abstract = {Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) have been studied extensively using statistical physics techniques. They provide a benchmark to study average case scenarios instead of the worst case one. The interplay between statistical physics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into the realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of clustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the class of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete degrees of freedom: standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising models) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models). In this work we consider instead problems that involve continuous degrees of freedom. The simplest prototype of these problems is the perceptron. Here we discuss in detail the full phase diagram of the model. In the regions of parameter space where the problem is non-convex, leading to multiple disconnected clusters of solutions, the solution is critical at the SAT/UNSAT threshold and lies in the same universality class of the jamming transition of soft spheres. We show how the critical behavior at the satisﬁability threshold emerges, and we compute the critical exponents associated to the approach to the transition from both the SAT and UNSAT phase. We conjecture that there is a large universality class of non-convex continuous CSPs whose SAT-UNSAT threshold is described by the same scaling solution.},

While the vibrational spectrum of jammed soft sphere solids has been fully described, the vibrational spectrum of hard spheres, a model for colloidal glasses, is still unknown due to the difficulty of treating the non-analytic interaction potential. We bypass this difficulty using the recently described effective interaction potential for the free energy of thermal hard spheres. By minimizing this effective free energy we mimic a quench and produce typical configurations of low temperature colloidal glasses. We measure the resulting vibrational spectrum and characterize its evolution towards the jamming point where configurations of hard and soft spheres are trivially unified. For densities approaching jamming from below, we observe low frequency modes which agree with those found in numerical simulations of jammed soft spheres. Our measurements of the vibrational structure demonstrate that the jamming universality extends away from jamming: hard sphere thermal systems below jamming exhibit the same vibrational spectra as thermal and athermal soft sphere systems above the transition.},
