Full acknowledgement of all the support I've received through the writing of this would be longer than the dissertation itself. Nevertheless, I'd like to take a moment to express my gratitude here to those who have contributed the most to this work.

First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Eric ``Irwin'' Corwin for his unwavering support over the past five years. Without your enthusiasm, expertise, and flexibility, this would not have been possible.

I am grateful as well for the excellent labmates that I have had here, for myriads of help and support: Cam Dennis, Francesco Arceri, Varda Faghir Hagh, Andy Hammond, Valerie Beale, Aileen Carroll-Godfrey, Jack Dale, Jacob Hass, Alex Trevelyan, Georgios Tsekenis, and Mike van der Naald. 

Special thanks to Sean Ridout for not only the contributions to the letter which we wrote together, but also for providing insightful feedback on my other projects. 
I would also like to acknowledge Francesco Zamponi for graciously elucidating mean field results with us.

Thanks to CorwinLab alumni Peter Morse for advice on both research and death cults, and Kyle Welch for getting us into PRL. I would also like to acknowledge my committee for their advice and support at various times throughout this process.

Lastly I would like to thank all my friends and family for their support, as well as innumerable fellow grad students, faculty, and staff who have helped me in various ways through this time.

This work was supported by the NSF Career Award grant No. DMR-1255370, and the Simons Collaboration on Cracking the Glass Problem (No. 454939 E. Corwin)}
