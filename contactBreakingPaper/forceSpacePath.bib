	abstract = {At the core of equilibrium statistical mechanics lies the notion of statistical ensembles: a collection of microstates, each occurring with a given a priori probability that depends only on a few macroscopic parameters such as temperature, pressure, volume, and energy. In this review article, we discuss recent advances in establishing statistical ensembles for athermal materials. The broad class of granular and particulate materials is immune from the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations because the constituents are macroscopic. In addition, interactions between grains are frictional and dissipative, which invalidates the fundamental postulates of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, granular materials exhibit distributions of microscopic quantities that are reproducible and often depend on only a few macroscopic parameters. We explore the history of statistical ensemble ideas in the context of granular materials, clarify the nature of such ensembles and their foundational principles, highlight advances in testing key ideas, and discuss applications of ensembles to analyze the collective behavior of granular materials.},

Here we study the statistics of ensembles of hyperstatic frictionless force networks, which are composed of more forces than can be determined uniquely from force balance. Hyperstatic force networks possess degrees of freedom that rearrange one balanced network into another. We calculate the equation of state and demonstrate that the number of rearrangements governs the macroscopic statistical properties of the ensemble, in particular the macroscopic ﬂuctuations of stress, which scale with distance to the isostatic point. We then show that a maximum entropy postulate allows one to quantitatively capture many features of the microscopic statistics.

	abstract = {Recent theoretical advances offer an exact, first-principle theory of jamming criticality in infinite dimension as well as universal scaling relations between critical exponents in all dimensions. For packings of frictionless spheres near the jamming transition, these advances predict that nontrivial power-law exponents characterize the critical distribution of (i) small inter-particle gaps and (ii) weak contact forces, both of which are crucial for mechanical stability. The scaling of the inter-particle gaps is known to be constant in all spatial dimensions \$d\$ -- including the physically relevant \$d=2\$ and 3, but the value of the weak force exponent remains the object of debate and confusion. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by numerical simulations. We construct isostatic jammed packings with extremely high accuracy, and introduce a simple criterion to separate the contribution of particles that give rise to localized buckling excitations, i.e., bucklers, from the others. This analysis reveals the remarkable dimensional robustness of mean-field marginality and its associated criticality.},

          , 
            
              Jamming occurs when objects like grains are packed tightly together (
              e.g.
              grain silos). It is highly cooperative and can lead to phenomena like earthquakes, traffic jams,
              etc.
              In this paper we point out the paramount importance of the underlying contact network for jammed systems; the network must have one contact in excess of isostaticity and a finite bulk modulus. Isostatic means that the number of degrees of freedom is exactly balanced by the number of constraints. This defines a large class of networks that can be constructed without the necessity of packing particles together compressively (either in the lab or computationally). One such construction, which we explore here, involves setting up the Delaunay triangulation of a Poisson disk sampling and then removing edges to maximize the bulk modulus until the isostatic plus one edge is reached. This construction works in any dimensions and here we give results in 2D where we also show how such networks can be transformed into disk packs.},

	abstract = {At zero temperature a disordered solid corresponds to a local minimum in the energy landscape. As the temperature is raised or the system is driven with a mechanical load, the system explores diﬀerent minima via dynamical events in which particles rearrange their relative positions. We have shown recently that the dynamics of particle rearrangements are strongly correlated with a structural quantity associated with each particle, “softness”, which we can identify using supervised machine learning. Particles of a given softness have a well-deﬁned energy scale that governs local rearrangements; because of this property, softness greatly simpliﬁes our understanding of glassy dynamics. Here we investigate the correlation of softness with other commonly used structural quantities, such as coordination number and local potential energy. We show that although softness strongly correlates with these properties, its predictive power for rearrangement dynamics is much higher. We introduce a useful metric for quantifying the quality of structural quantities as predictors of dynamics. We hope that, in the future, authors introducing new structural measures of dynamics will compare their proposals quantitatively to softness using this metric. We also show how softness correlations give insight into rearrangements. Finally, we explore the physical meaning of softness using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and reduced curve-ﬁtting models, and show that softness can be recast in a form that is amenable to analytical treatment.},

We show that these correlations can be successfully probed by introducing a correlation function weighted on the density-density fluctuations. The results of this analysis can be further improved by introducing a representation of the system based on the contact points between particles. In particular, we find evidence that the weak forces and the \{{\textbackslash}Delta\}Z fluctuations support the hypothesis of randomly jammed packings of spherical particles being hyperuniform by exhibiting an anomalous long-range decay. Moreover, we find that the large-scale structure of the density-density correlation exhibits a complex behavior due to the superimposition of two exponentially damped oscillating signals propagating with linearly depending frequencies.},

            We develop a new method to isolate localized defects from extended vibrational modes in disordered solids. This method augments particle interactions with an artificial potential that acts as a high-pass filter: it preserves small-scale structures while pushing extended vibrational modes to higher frequencies. The low-frequency modes that remain are “bare” defects; they are exponentially localized without the quadrupolar tails associated with elastic interactions. We demonstrate that these localized excitations are excellent predictors of plastic rearrangements in the solid. We characterize several of the properties of these defects that appear in mesoscopic theory of plasticity, including their distribution of energy barriers, number density, and size, which is a first step in testing and revising continuum models for plasticity in disordered solids.},

	abstract = {No known analytic framework precisely explains all the phenomena observed in jamming. The replica theory for glasses and jamming is a mean-field theory which attempts to do so by working in the limit of infinite dimensions, such that correlations between neighbors are negligible. As such, results from this mean-field theory are not guaranteed to be observed in finite dimensions. However, many results in mean field for jamming have been shown to be exact or nearly exact in low dimensions. This suggests that the infinite dimensional limit is not necessary to obtain these results. In this Letter, we perform precision measurements of jamming scaling relationships between pressure, excess packing fraction, and number of excess contacts from dimensions 2–10 in order to extract the prefactors to these scalings. While these prefactors should be highly sensitive to finite dimensional corrections, we find the mean-field predictions for these prefactors to be exact in low dimensions. Thus the mean-field approximation is not necessary for deriving these prefactors. We present an exact, first-principles derivation for one, leaving the other as an open question. Our results suggest that mean-field theories of critical phenomena may compute more for d≥du than has been previously appreciated.},

          , 
            A load applied to a jammed frictional granular system will be localized into a network of force chains making inter-particle connections throughout the system. Because such systems are typically under-constrained, the observed force network is not unique to a given particle configuration, but instead varies upon repeated formation. In this paper, we examine the ensemble of force chain configurations created under repeated assembly in order to develop tools to statistically forecast the observed force network. In experiments on a gently suspended 2D layer of photoelastic particles, we subject the assembly to hundreds of repeated cyclic compressions. As expected, we observe the non-unique nature of the force network, which differs for each compression cycle, by measuring all vector inter-particle contact forces using our open source PeGS software. We find that total pressure on each particle in the system correlates to its betweenness centrality value extracted from the geometric contact network. Thus, the mesoscale network structure is a key control on individual particle pressures.},

Recent advances have led to protocols that can create particularly stable amorphous solids. Such systems, whether they be physical systems created using vapor-deposition or numerical model systems created using swap or breathing algorithms, exist in exceptionally deep energy minima marked by the absence of low-frequency quasilocalized modes. We introduce new numerical protocols for creating stable jammed packings that first introduce and subsequently remove degrees of freedom such as particle sizes or particle stiffnesses. We find that different choices for the degrees of freedom can lead to very different results. For jammed packings, degrees of freedom that couple to the jamming transition, e.g., particle sizes, push the system to much more stable and deeper energy minima than those that only couple to interaction stiffnesses.},

	abstract = {The plasticity of amorphous solids undergoing shear is characterized by quasi-localized rearrangements of particles. While many models of plasticity exist, the precise relationship between the plastic dynamics and the structure of a particle’s local environment remains an open question. Previously, machine learning was used to identify a structural predictor of rearrangements called “softness.” Although softness has been shown to predict which particles will rearrange with high accuracy, the method can be difficult to implement in experiments where data are limited and the combinations of descriptors it identifies are often difficult to interpret physically. Here, we address both of these weaknesses, presenting two major improvements to the standard softness method. First, we present a natural representation of each particle’s observed mobility, allowing for the use of statistical models that are both simpler and provide greater accuracy in limited datasets. Second, we employ persistent homology as a systematic means of identifying simple, topologically informed, structural quantities that are easy to interpret and measure experimentally. We test our methods on two-dimensional athermal packings of soft spheres under quasi-static shear. We find that the same structural information that predicts small variations in the response is also predictive of where plastic events will localize. We also find that an excellent accuracy is achieved in athermal sheared packings using simply a particle’s species and the number of nearest neighbor contacts.},

	abstract = {In jammed packings, it is usually thought that local structure only plays a significant role in specific regimes. The standard deviation of the relative excess coordination, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_Z/ Z\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{c\}\$, decays like \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\}\$, so that local structure should play no role in high spatial dimensions. Furthermore, in any fixed dimension \$d {\textbackslash}geq 2\$, there are diverging length scales as the pressure vanishes approaching the unjamming transition, again suggesting that local structure should not be sufficient to describe response. Here we challenge the assumption that local structure does not matter in these cases. In simulations of jammed packings under athermal, quasistatic shear, we use machine learning to identify a local structural variable, softness, that correlates with rearrangements in dimensions \$d=2\$ to \$d=5\$. We find that softness - and even just the coordination number \$Z\$ - are quite predictive of rearrangements over a wide range of pressures, all the way down to unjamming, in all \$d\$ studied. This result provides direct evidence that local structure can play a role in higher spatial dimensions.},

	abstract = {There are two ways to transition between different contact networks, point and jump changes, as shown in a packing fraction-strain landscape.
          , 
            We investigate the mechanical response of packings of purely repulsive, frictionless disks to quasistatic deformations. The deformations include simple shear strain at constant packing fraction and at constant pressure, “polydispersity” strain (in which we change the particle size distribution) at constant packing fraction and at constant pressure, and isotropic compression. For each deformation, we show that there are two classes of changes in the interparticle contact networks: jump changes and point changes. Jump changes occur when a contact network becomes mechanically unstable, particles “rearrange”, and the potential energy (when the strain is applied at constant packing fraction) or enthalpy (when the strain is applied at constant pressure) and all derivatives are discontinuous. During point changes, a single contact is either added to or removed from the contact network. For repulsive linear spring interactions, second- and higher-order derivatives of the potential energy/enthalpy are discontinuous at a point change, while for Hertzian interactions, third- and higher-order derivatives of the potential energy/enthalpy are discontinuous. We illustrate the importance of point changes by studying the transition from a hexagonal crystal to a disordered crystal induced by applying polydispersity strain. During this transition, the system only undergoes point changes, with no jump changes. We emphasize that one must understand point changes, as well as jump changes, to predict the mechanical properties of jammed packings.},

	abstract = {We numerically study the jamming transition of frictionless polydisperse spheres in three dimensions. We use an efﬁcient thermalisation algorithm for the equilibrium hard sphere ﬂuid and generate amorphous jammed packings over a range of critical jamming densities that is about three times broader than in previous studies. This allows us to reexamine a wide range of structural properties characterizing the jamming transition. Both isostaticity and the critical behavior of the pair correlation function hold over the entire range of jamming densities. At intermediate length scales, we ﬁnd a weak, smooth increase of bond orientational order. By contrast, distorted icosahedral structures grow rapidly with increasing the volume fraction in both ﬂuid and jammed states. Surprisingly, at large scale we observe that denser jammed states show stronger deviations from hyperuniformity, suggesting that the enhanced amorphous ordering inherited from the equilibrium ﬂuid competes with, rather than enhances, hyperuniformity. Finally, ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations of the critical jamming density are considerably suppressed in the denser jammed states, indicating an important change in the topography of the potential energy landscape. By considerably stretching the amplitude of the critical “J-line”, our work disentangles physical properties at the contact scale that are associated with jamming criticality, from those occurring at larger length scales, which have a different nature.},
