Force networks are an essential element to understanding the behaviors of jammed packings. As such, the Force Network Ensemble was formulated to contain the space of all possible force networks for a packing. In this work we demonstrate two new applications of the Force Network Ensemble, showing that it is a versatile tool that can be used to learn more about jammed systems. First, we use the Force Network Ensemble to calculate the entropy of a packing's force networks, concreletely linking a microscopic measure with bulk themodynmaic approaches. Second, we use the Force Network Ensemble to predict contact changes in a packing under decompression. And lastly, we show precision measurements of several jamming scaling laws, showing that mean field results are applicable for not just the scaling exponent, but also the prefactors.
