\abstract{Force networks are an essential element to understanding the behaviors of jammed packings. As such, the Force Network Ensemble was formulated to describe the space of all possible force networks for a packing. In this work we study the Force Network Ensemble, showing that it is a versatile tool that can be used to learn more about jammed systems. We do so by demonstrating two new applications of the Force Network Ensemble, and additionally we examine scaling law prefactors, connecting mean field results with low dimensional jamming. In the first application, we use the Force Network Ensemble to calculate the entropy of a packing's force networks, concreletely linking a microscopic measure with bulk themodynmaic approaches. In the second, we use the Force Network Ensemble to predict contact changes in a packing under decompression. Finally, we show precision measurements of several jamming scaling laws, showing that mean field results are applicable for not just the scaling exponent, but also the prefactors.
