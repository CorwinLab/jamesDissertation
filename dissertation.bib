	abstract = {We poorly understand the properties of amorphous systems at small length scales, where a continuous elastic description breaks down. This is apparent when one considers their vibrational and transport properties, or the way forces propagate in these solids. Little is known about the microscopic cause of their rigidity. Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly of elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where the pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a continuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling is observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the density of vibrational modes. In the present work, we derive theoretically these results, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter and silica, but also to colloidal glasses. In particular we show that: (i) these systems present a large excess of vibrational modes at low frequency in comparison with normal solids, called the “boson peak” in the glass literature. The corresponding modes are very diﬀerent from plane waves, and their frequency is related to the system coordination; (ii) rigidity is a non-local property of the packing geometry, characterized by a length scale which can be large. For elastic particles this length diverges near the jamming transition; (iii) for repulsive systems the shear modulus can be much smaller than the bulk modulus. We compute the corresponding scaling laws near the jamming threshold. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the glass transition, the transport, and the geometry of the random close packing.},

So far, however, there exists no theoretical framework which can explain the observations in a unified manner beyond the phenomenological jamming diagram [1]. This work focuses on the case of static granular matter, where we have constructed a statistical ensemble [2] which mirrors equilibrium statistical mechanics. This ensemble, which is based on the conservation properties of the stress tensor, is distinct from the original Edwards ensemble and applies to packings of deformable grains. We combine it with a field theoretical analysis of the packings, where the field is the Airy stress function derived from the force and torque balance conditions. In this framework, Point J characterized by a diverging stiffness of the pressure fluctuations. Separately, we present a phenomenological mean-field theory of the jamming transition, which incorporates the mean contact number as a variable. We link both approaches in the context of the marginal rigidity picture proposed by [3, 4].},

A microcanonical ensemble deﬁnes the entropy from volume V , where V equals the volume function W , just as E equals H in conventional statistical physics. A canonical version exists via a compactivity ∂V /∂S. Granular systems also have a distribution of intergranular forces generated by external forces or gravity. This paper shows that the idea that the conﬁgurations are determined by the Gibbsian formula exp(−W (∂S/∂V )) can be extended to the distribution of forces with a microcanonical condition P (external) = (force moments in grains)/V via exp(− (∂S/∂P )). The canonical ensemble immediately gives the exponential distribution of intergranular forces, found experimentally. The distribution must depend on the conﬁguration and any physical property will have a value averaged over conﬁgurations, i.e. will give rise to a spinglass problem.},

	abstract = {We present the first study of disordered jammed hard-sphere packings in four-, five- and six-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Using a collision-driven packing generation algorithm, we obtain the first estimates for the packing fractions of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) states for space dimensions \$d=4\$, 5 and 6 to be \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{MRJ\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.46\$, 0.31 and 0.20, respectively. To a good approximation, the MRJ density obeys the scaling form \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{MRJ\}= c\_1/2{\textasciicircum}d+(c\_2 d)/2{\textasciicircum}d\$, where \$c\_1=-2.72\$ and \$c\_2=2.56\$, which appears to be consistent with high-dimensional asymptotic limit, albeit with different coefficients. Calculations of the pair correlation function \$g\_\{2\}(r)\$ and structure factor \$S(k)\$ for these states show that short-range ordering appreciably decreases with increasing dimension, consistent with a recently proposed ``decorrelation principle,'' which, among othe things, states that unconstrained correlations diminish as the dimension increases and vanish entirely in the limit \$d {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$. As in three dimensions (where \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{MRJ\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.64\$), the packings show no signs of crystallization, are isostatic, and have a power-law divergence in \$g\_\{2\}(r)\$ at contact with power-law exponent \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.4\$. Across dimensions, the cumulative number of neighbors equals the kissing number of the conjectured densest packing close to where \$g\_\{2\}(r)\$ has its first minimum. We obtain estimates for the freezing and melting desnities for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid-solid transition, \${\textbackslash}phi\_F {\textbackslash}simeq 0.32\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi\_M {\textbackslash}simeq 0.39\$, respectively, for \$d=4\$, and \${\textbackslash}phi\_F {\textbackslash}simeq 0.19\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi\_M {\textbackslash}simeq 0.24\$, respectively, for \$d=5\$.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper we derived an expression for the replicated free energy of a liquid of hard spheres based on the hypernetted chain (HNC) free energy functional. An approximate equation of state for the glass and an estimate of the random close packing density were obtained for d = 3. Here we show that the HNC approximation is not needed: the same expression can be obtained from the full diagrammatic expansion of the replicated free energy. Then, we consider the asymptotics of this expression when the space dimension d is very large. In this limit, the entropy of the hard sphere liquid has been computed exactly. Using this solution, we derive asymptotic expressions for the glass transition density and for the random close packing density for hard spheres for large space dimension.},

	abstract = {Amorphous packings prepared in the vicinity of the jamming transition play a central role in theoretical studies of the vibrational spectrum of glasses. Two mean-field theories predict that the vibrational density of states \$g({\textbackslash}omega)\$ obeys a characteristic power law, \$g({\textbackslash}omega){\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2\$, called the non-Debye scaling in the low-frequency region. Numerical studies have however reported that this scaling breaks down at low frequencies, due to finite dimensional effects. In this study, we prepare amorphous packings of up to \$128000\$ particles in spatial dimensions from \$d=3\$ to \$d=9\$ to characterise the range of validity of the non-Debye scaling. Our numerical results suggest that the non-Debye scaling is obeyed down to a frequency that gradually decreases as \$d\$ increases, and possibly vanishes for large \$d\$, in agreement with mean-field predictions. We also show that the prestress is an efficient control parameter to quantitatively compare packings across different spatial dimensions.},

However, recent theoretical breakthroughs have led to the formulation of an exact solution of a microscopic glass-forming model in the mean-ﬁeld limit of inﬁnite spatial dimension. Numerical simulations have remarkably conﬁrmed the dimensional robustness of some of the predictions. This review describes these latest advances. More speciﬁcally, we consider the dynamical and thermodynamic descriptions of hard spheres around the dynamical, Gardner, and jamming transitions. Comparing mean-ﬁeld predictions with the ﬁnitedimensional simulations, we identify robust aspects of the theory and uncover its more sensitive features.

	abstract = {The unconventional thermal properties of jammed amorphous solids are directly related to their density of vibrational states. While the vibrational spectrum of jammed soft sphere solids has been fully described, the vibrational spectrum of hard spheres, a model for colloidal glasses, is still unknown due to the difficulty of treating the non-analytic interaction potential. We bypass this difficulty using the recently described effective interaction potential for the free energy of thermal hard spheres. By minimizing this effective free energy we mimic a quench and produce typical configurations of low temperature colloidal glasses. We measure the resulting vibrational spectrum and characterize its evolution towards the jamming point where configurations of hard and soft spheres are trivially unified. For densities approaching jamming from below, we observe low frequency modes which agree with those found in numerical simulations of jammed soft spheres. Our measurements of the vibrational structure demonstrate that the jamming universality extends away from jamming: hard sphere thermal systems below jamming exhibit the same vibrational spectra as thermal and athermal soft sphere systems above the transition.},

	abstract = {Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) have been studied extensively using statistical physics techniques. They provide a benchmark to study average case scenarios instead of the worst case one. The interplay between statistical physics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into the realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of clustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the class of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete degrees of freedom: standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising models) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models). In this work we consider instead problems that involve continuous degrees of freedom. The simplest prototype of these problems is the perceptron. Here we discuss in detail the full phase diagram of the model. In the regions of parameter space where the problem is non-convex, leading to multiple disconnected clusters of solutions, the solution is critical at the SAT/UNSAT threshold and lies in the same universality class of the jamming transition of soft spheres. We show how the critical behavior at the satisﬁability threshold emerges, and we compute the critical exponents associated to the approach to the transition from both the SAT and UNSAT phase. We conjecture that there is a large universality class of non-convex continuous CSPs whose SAT-UNSAT threshold is described by the same scaling solution.},

Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the ﬂuid phase. In this way jamming is very diﬀerent from crystallization, the other common way in which a ﬂuid solidiﬁes. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many diﬀerent types of ﬂuids – from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter –develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model of frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive ﬁnite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly-idealized case, the transition has aspects of both ﬁrst- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We ﬁrst survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable.},

When z  {\textless}  zc  ≈  2d, where d is the spatial dimension, frames are unstable with respect to internal deformations. This pedagogical review focuses on the properties of frames with z at or near zc, which model systems like randomly packed spheres near jamming and network glasses. Using an index theorem, N0  −NS  =  dN  −NB relating the number of sites, N, and number of bonds, NB, to the number, N0, of modes of zero energy and the number, NS, of states of self stress, in which springs can be under positive or negative tension while forces on sites remain zero, it explores the properties of periodic square, kagome, and related lattices for which z  =  zc and the relation between states of self stress and zero modes in periodic lattices to the surface zero modes of finite free lattices (with free boundary conditions). It shows how modifications to the periodic kagome lattice can eliminate all but trivial translational zero modes and create topologically distinct classes, analogous to those of topological insulators, with protected zero modes at free boundaries and at interfaces between different topological classes.},

We show that this point-to-set (PTS) correlation function exhibits a dominant length scale that diverges as the unjamming transition is approached through decompression. In addition, we identify deviations from mean-field predictions, and present detailed analysis of the origin of non-mean-field behavior. A mean-field bulk-surface argument is reviewed. Corrections to this argument are identified, which lead to a change in the functional form of the critical PTS boundary size R0. An entropic description of the origin of the correlations is presented, and simple rigidity assumptions are shown to predict the functional form of R0 as a function of the pressure P.},

	abstract = {No known analytic framework precisely explains all the phenomena observed in jamming. The replica theory for glasses and jamming is a mean-field theory which attempts to do so by working in the limit of infinite dimensions, such that correlations between neighbors are negligible. As such, results from this mean-field theory are not guaranteed to be observed in finite dimensions. However, many results in mean field for jamming have been shown to be exact or nearly exact in low dimensions. This suggests that the infinite dimensional limit is not necessary to obtain these results. In this Letter, we perform precision measurements of jamming scaling relationships between pressure, excess packing fraction, and number of excess contacts from dimensions 2–10 in order to extract the prefactors to these scalings. While these prefactors should be highly sensitive to finite dimensional corrections, we find the mean-field predictions for these prefactors to be exact in low dimensions. Thus the mean-field approximation is not necessary for deriving these prefactors. We present an exact, first-principles derivation for one, leaving the other as an open question. Our results suggest that mean-field theories of critical phenomena may compute more for d≥du than has been previously appreciated.},

          , 
            
              Jamming occurs when objects like grains are packed tightly together (
              e.g.
              grain silos). It is highly cooperative and can lead to phenomena like earthquakes, traffic jams,
              etc.
              In this paper we point out the paramount importance of the underlying contact network for jammed systems; the network must have one contact in excess of isostaticity and a finite bulk modulus. Isostatic means that the number of degrees of freedom is exactly balanced by the number of constraints. This defines a large class of networks that can be constructed without the necessity of packing particles together compressively (either in the lab or computationally). One such construction, which we explore here, involves setting up the Delaunay triangulation of a Poisson disk sampling and then removing edges to maximize the bulk modulus until the isostatic plus one edge is reached. This construction works in any dimensions and here we give results in 2D where we also show how such networks can be transformed into disk packs.},

The measure of this strain, which will be represented by

            We develop a new method to isolate localized defects from extended vibrational modes in disordered solids. This method augments particle interactions with an artificial potential that acts as a high-pass filter: it preserves small-scale structures while pushing extended vibrational modes to higher frequencies. The low-frequency modes that remain are “bare” defects; they are exponentially localized without the quadrupolar tails associated with elastic interactions. We demonstrate that these localized excitations are excellent predictors of plastic rearrangements in the solid. We characterize several of the properties of these defects that appear in mesoscopic theory of plasticity, including their distribution of energy barriers, number density, and size, which is a first step in testing and revising continuum models for plasticity in disordered solids.},

In this review article, we discuss recent advances in establishing statistical ensembles for athermal materials. The broad class of granular and particulate materials is immune from the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations because the constituents are macroscopic. In addition, interactions between grains are frictional and dissipative, which invalidates the fundamental postulates of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, granular materials exhibit distributions of microscopic quantities that are reproducible and often depend on only a few macroscopic parameters. We explore the history of statistical ensemble ideas in the context of granular materials, clarify the nature of such ensembles and their foundational principles, highlight advances in testing key ideas, and discuss applications of ensembles to analyze the collective behavior of granular materials.},

For packings of frictionless spheres near the jamming transition, these advances predict that nontrivial power-law exponents characterize the critical distribution of (i) small inter-particle gaps and (ii) weak contact forces, both of which are crucial for mechanical stability. The scaling of the inter-particle gaps is known to be constant in all spatial dimensions \$d\$ -- including the physically relevant \$d=2\$ and 3, but the value of the weak force exponent remains the object of debate and confusion. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by numerical simulations. We construct isostatic jammed packings with extremely high accuracy, and introduce a simple criterion to separate the contribution of particles that give rise to localized buckling excitations, i.e., bucklers, from the others. This analysis reveals the remarkable dimensional robustness of mean-field marginality and its associated criticality.},

Hyperstatic force networks possess degrees of freedom that rearrange one balanced network into another. We calculate the equation of state and demonstrate that the number of rearrangements governs the macroscopic statistical properties of the ensemble, in particular the macroscopic ﬂuctuations of stress, which scale with distance to the isostatic point. We then show that a maximum entropy postulate allows one to quantitatively capture many features of the microscopic statistics.

We show that these correlations can be successfully probed by introducing a correlation function weighted on the density-density fluctuations. The results of this analysis can be further improved by introducing a representation of the system based on the contact points between particles. In particular, we find evidence that the weak forces and the \{{\textbackslash}Delta\}Z fluctuations support the hypothesis of randomly jammed packings of spherical particles being hyperuniform by exhibiting an anomalous long-range decay. Moreover, we find that the large-scale structure of the density-density correlation exhibits a complex behavior due to the superimposition of two exponentially damped oscillating signals propagating with linearly depending frequencies.},

	abstract = {At zero temperature a disordered solid corresponds to a local minimum in the energy landscape. As the temperature is raised or the system is driven with a mechanical load, the system explores diﬀerent minima via dynamical events in which particles rearrange their relative positions. We have shown recently that the dynamics of particle rearrangements are strongly correlated with a structural quantity associated with each particle, “softness”, which we can identify using supervised machine learning. Particles of a given softness have a well-deﬁned energy scale that governs local rearrangements; because of this property, softness greatly simpliﬁes our understanding of glassy dynamics. Here we investigate the correlation of softness with other commonly used structural quantities, such as coordination number and local potential energy. We show that although softness strongly correlates with these properties, its predictive power for rearrangement dynamics is much higher. We introduce a useful metric for quantifying the quality of structural quantities as predictors of dynamics. We hope that, in the future, authors introducing new structural measures of dynamics will compare their proposals quantitatively to softness using this metric. We also show how softness correlations give insight into rearrangements. Finally, we explore the physical meaning of softness using unsupervised dimensionality reduction and reduced curve-ﬁtting models, and show that softness can be recast in a form that is amenable to analytical treatment.},

Because such systems are typically under-constrained, the observed force network is not unique to a given particle configuration, but instead varies upon repeated formation. In this paper, we examine the ensemble of force chain configurations created under repeated assembly in order to develop tools to statistically forecast the observed force network. In experiments on a gently suspended 2D layer of photoelastic particles, we subject the assembly to hundreds of repeated cyclic compressions. As expected, we observe the non-unique nature of the force network, which differs for each compression cycle, by measuring all vector inter-particle contact forces using our open source PeGS software. We find that total pressure on each particle in the system correlates to its betweenness centrality value extracted from the geometric contact network. Thus, the mesoscale network structure is a key control on individual particle pressures.},

Recent advances have led to protocols that can create particularly stable amorphous solids. Such systems, whether they be physical systems created using vapor-deposition or numerical model systems created using swap or breathing algorithms, exist in exceptionally deep energy minima marked by the absence of low-frequency quasilocalized modes. We introduce new numerical protocols for creating stable jammed packings that first introduce and subsequently remove degrees of freedom such as particle sizes or particle stiffnesses. We find that different choices for the degrees of freedom can lead to very different results. For jammed packings, degrees of freedom that couple to the jamming transition, e.g., particle sizes, push the system to much more stable and deeper energy minima than those that only couple to interaction stiffnesses.},

We use an efﬁcient thermalisation algorithm for the equilibrium hard sphere ﬂuid and generate amorphous jammed packings over a range of critical jamming densities that is about three times broader than in previous studies. This allows us to reexamine a wide range of structural properties characterizing the jamming transition. Both isostaticity and the critical behavior of the pair correlation function hold over the entire range of jamming densities. At intermediate length scales, we ﬁnd a weak, smooth increase of bond orientational order. By contrast, distorted icosahedral structures grow rapidly with increasing the volume fraction in both ﬂuid and jammed states. Surprisingly, at large scale we observe that denser jammed states show stronger deviations from hyperuniformity, suggesting that the enhanced amorphous ordering inherited from the equilibrium ﬂuid competes with, rather than enhances, hyperuniformity. Finally, ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations of the critical jamming density are considerably suppressed in the denser jammed states, indicating an important change in the topography of the potential energy landscape. By considerably stretching the amplitude of the critical “J-line”, our work disentangles physical properties at the contact scale that are associated with jamming criticality, from those occurring at larger length scales, which have a different nature.},

          , 
            We investigate the mechanical response of packings of purely repulsive, frictionless disks to quasistatic deformations. The deformations include simple shear strain at constant packing fraction and at constant pressure, “polydispersity” strain (in which we change the particle size distribution) at constant packing fraction and at constant pressure, and isotropic compression. For each deformation, we show that there are two classes of changes in the interparticle contact networks: jump changes and point changes. Jump changes occur when a contact network becomes mechanically unstable, particles “rearrange”, and the potential energy (when the strain is applied at constant packing fraction) or enthalpy (when the strain is applied at constant pressure) and all derivatives are discontinuous. During point changes, a single contact is either added to or removed from the contact network. For repulsive linear spring interactions, second- and higher-order derivatives of the potential energy/enthalpy are discontinuous at a point change, while for Hertzian interactions, third- and higher-order derivatives of the potential energy/enthalpy are discontinuous. We illustrate the importance of point changes by studying the transition from a hexagonal crystal to a disordered crystal induced by applying polydispersity strain. During this transition, the system only undergoes point changes, with no jump changes. We emphasize that one must understand point changes, as well as jump changes, to predict the mechanical properties of jammed packings.},

	abstract = {The plasticity of amorphous solids undergoing shear is characterized by quasi-localized rearrangements of particles. While many models of plasticity exist, the precise relationship between the plastic dynamics and the structure of a particle’s local environment remains an open question. Previously, machine learning was used to identify a structural predictor of rearrangements called “softness.” Although softness has been shown to predict which particles will rearrange with high accuracy, the method can be difficult to implement in experiments where data are limited and the combinations of descriptors it identifies are often difficult to interpret physically. Here, we address both of these weaknesses, presenting two major improvements to the standard softness method. First, we present a natural representation of each particle’s observed mobility, allowing for the use of statistical models that are both simpler and provide greater accuracy in limited datasets. Second, we employ persistent homology as a systematic means of identifying simple, topologically informed, structural quantities that are easy to interpret and measure experimentally. We test our methods on two-dimensional athermal packings of soft spheres under quasi-static shear. We find that the same structural information that predicts small variations in the response is also predictive of where plastic events will localize. We also find that an excellent accuracy is achieved in athermal sheared packings using simply a particle’s species and the number of nearest neighbor contacts.},

The standard deviation of the relative excess coordination, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_Z/ Z\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{c\}\$, decays like \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\}\$, so that local structure should play no role in high spatial dimensions. Furthermore, in any fixed dimension \$d {\textbackslash}geq 2\$, there are diverging length scales as the pressure vanishes approaching the unjamming transition, again suggesting that local structure should not be sufficient to describe response. Here we challenge the assumption that local structure does not matter in these cases. In simulations of jammed packings under athermal, quasistatic shear, we use machine learning to identify a local structural variable, softness, that correlates with rearrangements in dimensions \$d=2\$ to \$d=5\$. We find that softness - and even just the coordination number \$Z\$ - are quite predictive of rearrangements over a wide range of pressures, all the way down to unjamming, in all \$d\$ studied.
