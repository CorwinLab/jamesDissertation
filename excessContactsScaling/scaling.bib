	abstract = {When a system jams it undergoes a transition from a ﬂowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the ﬂuid phase. In this way jamming is very diﬀerent from crystallization, the other common way in which a ﬂuid solidiﬁes. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many diﬀerent types of ﬂuids – from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter –develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model of frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive ﬁnite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly-idealized case, the transition has aspects of both ﬁrst- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We ﬁrst survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable.},

	abstract = {Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) have been studied extensively using statistical physics techniques. They provide a benchmark to study average case scenarios instead of the worst case one. The interplay between statistical physics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into the realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of clustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the class of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete degrees of freedom: standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising models) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models). In this work we consider instead problems that involve continuous degrees of freedom. The simplest prototype of these problems is the perceptron. Here we discuss in detail the full phase diagram of the model. In the regions of parameter space where the problem is non-convex, leading to multiple disconnected clusters of solutions, the solution is critical at the SAT/UNSAT threshold and lies in the same universality class of the jamming transition of soft spheres. We show how the critical behavior at the satisﬁability threshold emerges, and we compute the critical exponents associated to the approach to the transition from both the SAT and UNSAT phase. We conjecture that there is a large universality class of non-convex continuous CSPs whose SAT-UNSAT threshold is described by the same scaling solution.},

While the vibrational spectrum of jammed soft sphere solids has been fully described, the vibrational spectrum of hard spheres, a model for colloidal glasses, is still unknown due to the difficulty of treating the non-analytic interaction potential. We bypass this difficulty using the recently described effective interaction potential for the free energy of thermal hard spheres. By minimizing this effective free energy we mimic a quench and produce typical configurations of low temperature colloidal glasses. We measure the resulting vibrational spectrum and characterize its evolution towards the jamming point where configurations of hard and soft spheres are trivially unified. For densities approaching jamming from below, we observe low frequency modes which agree with those found in numerical simulations of jammed soft spheres. Our measurements of the vibrational structure demonstrate that the jamming universality extends away from jamming: hard sphere thermal systems below jamming exhibit the same vibrational spectra as thermal and athermal soft sphere systems above the transition.},

Using an index theorem, N0  −NS  =  dN  −NB relating the number of sites, N, and number of bonds, NB, to the number, N0, of modes of zero energy and the number, NS, of states of self stress, in which springs can be under positive or negative tension while forces on sites remain zero, it explores the properties of periodic square, kagome, and related lattices for which z  =  zc and the relation between states of self stress and zero modes in periodic lattices to the surface zero modes of finite free lattices (with free boundary conditions). It shows how modifications to the periodic kagome lattice can eliminate all but trivial translational zero modes and create topologically distinct classes, analogous to those of topological insulators, with protected zero modes at free boundaries and at interfaces between different topological classes.},

	abstract = {We poorly understand the properties of amorphous systems at small length scales, where a continuous elastic description breaks down. This is apparent when one considers their vibrational and transport properties, or the way forces propagate in these solids. Little is known about the microscopic cause of their rigidity. Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly of elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where the pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a continuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling is observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the density of vibrational modes. In the present work, we derive theoretically these results, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter and silica, but also to colloidal glasses. In particular we show that: (i) these systems present a large excess of vibrational modes at low frequency in comparison with normal solids, called the “boson peak” in the glass literature. The corresponding modes are very diﬀerent from plane waves, and their frequency is related to the system coordination; (ii) rigidity is a non-local property of the packing geometry, characterized by a length scale which can be large. For elastic particles this length diverges near the jamming transition; (iii) for repulsive systems the shear modulus can be much smaller than the bulk modulus. We compute the corresponding scaling laws near the jamming threshold. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the glass transition, the transport, and the geometry of the random close packing.},

	abstract = {Despite decades of work, gaining a ﬁrst-principles understanding of amorphous materials remains an extremely challenging problem. However, recent theoretical breakthroughs have led to the formulation of an exact solution of a microscopic glass-forming model in the mean-ﬁeld limit of inﬁnite spatial dimension. Numerical simulations have remarkably conﬁrmed the dimensional robustness of some of the predictions. This review describes these latest advances. More speciﬁcally, we consider the dynamical and thermodynamic descriptions of hard spheres around the dynamical, Gardner, and jamming transitions. Comparing mean-ﬁeld predictions with the ﬁnitedimensional simulations, we identify robust aspects of the theory and uncover its more sensitive features. We conclude with a brief overview of ongoing research.},

A number of nontrivial physical signatures associated to the Gardner transition have since been considered in various areas, from models of structural glasses to constraint satisfaction problems. This Perspective surveys these recent advances and discusses the novel research opportunities that arise from them.},

	abstract = {Amorphous packings prepared in the vicinity of the jamming transition play a central role in theoretical studies of the vibrational spectrum of glasses. Two mean-field theories predict that the vibrational density of states \$g({\textbackslash}omega)\$ obeys a characteristic power law, \$g({\textbackslash}omega){\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2\$, called the non-Debye scaling in the low-frequency region. Numerical studies have however reported that this scaling breaks down at low frequencies, due to finite dimensional effects. In this study, we prepare amorphous packings of up to \$128000\$ particles in spatial dimensions from \$d=3\$ to \$d=9\$ to characterise the range of validity of the non-Debye scaling. Our numerical results suggest that the non-Debye scaling is obeyed down to a frequency that gradually decreases as \$d\$ increases, and possibly vanishes for large \$d\$, in agreement with mean-field predictions. We also show that the prestress is an efficient control parameter to quantitatively compare packings across different spatial dimensions.},

An approximate equation of state for the glass and an estimate of the random close packing density were obtained for d = 3. Here we show that the HNC approximation is not needed: the same expression can be obtained from the full diagrammatic expansion of the replicated free energy. Then, we consider the asymptotics of this expression when the space dimension d is very large. In this limit, the entropy of the hard sphere liquid has been computed exactly. Using this solution, we derive asymptotic expressions for the glass transition density and for the random close packing density for hard spheres for large space dimension.},

	abstract = {We present the first study of disordered jammed hard-sphere packings in four-, five- and six-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Using a collision-driven packing generation algorithm, we obtain the first estimates for the packing fractions of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) states for space dimensions \$d=4\$, 5 and 6 to be \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{MRJ\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.46\$, 0.31 and 0.20, respectively. To a good approximation, the MRJ density obeys the scaling form \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{MRJ\}= c\_1/2{\textasciicircum}d+(c\_2 d)/2{\textasciicircum}d\$, where \$c\_1=-2.72\$ and \$c\_2=2.56\$, which appears to be consistent with high-dimensional asymptotic limit, albeit with different coefficients. Calculations of the pair correlation function \$g\_\{2\}(r)\$ and structure factor \$S(k)\$ for these states show that short-range ordering appreciably decreases with increasing dimension, consistent with a recently proposed ``decorrelation principle,'' which, among othe things, states that unconstrained correlations diminish as the dimension increases and vanish entirely in the limit \$d {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$. As in three dimensions (where \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{MRJ\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.64\$), the packings show no signs of crystallization, are isostatic, and have a power-law divergence in \$g\_\{2\}(r)\$ at contact with power-law exponent \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.4\$. Across dimensions, the cumulative number of neighbors equals the kissing number of the conjectured densest packing close to where \$g\_\{2\}(r)\$ has its first minimum. We obtain estimates for the freezing and melting desnities for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid-solid transition, \${\textbackslash}phi\_F {\textbackslash}simeq 0.32\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi\_M {\textbackslash}simeq 0.39\$, respectively, for \$d=4\$, and \${\textbackslash}phi\_F {\textbackslash}simeq 0.19\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi\_M {\textbackslash}simeq 0.24\$, respectively, for \$d=5\$.},
